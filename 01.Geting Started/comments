React is a library for User Interface.
It works like a mobile app.
We can split the page into components which we can reuse.
We can reuse a component many times.

React components can be just a function returning HTML, is uses JSX.

ReactDOM library is needed to render the HTML returned from  a component.




EXAMPLE : 

.jsx file :

function Person (props) {
  return (
    <div className="person">
      <h1>{ props.name }</h1>
      <p> Age :{ props.age }</p>
    </div>
  )
}

var app = (
  <div>
    <Person name="Atanas" age="25"/>
    <Person name="Asen" age="32"/>
  </div>
)

ReactDOM.render(app, document.querySelector('#app'));




.html file : 

<div id="app"></div>







WHY USING REACT ? 
    It's a build in front end framework which helps us build UI and it's easy to use.
    By using just valila JavaScript it would be a nightmare.



Alternatives to ReactJS are: 
    Angular and Vue.js are great too.
    Jquery is not, it's just for the DOM but the others allows us to create apps and their buisness and logic.



SPA (Single Page App) and MPA (Multy Page App) :
    In SPA :
        01.We get only ONE HTML file from the Server i the beginning.
        02.The page is split in the components and managed in JS and JSX.
        03.Page does not need to reload !

    In MPA :
        01.We get many HTML files form the server.
        02.Not everithing is managed by ReactJS.
        03.Many parts of the page dont know of the existance of other parts.


IMPORTANT :
SPA is better to use than MPA !!!!!

We will use the in the future.
    01.The basics,
    02.Debugging a ReactJS app,
    03.Styling ReactJS Components,
    04.Components advanced,
    05.HTTP Requests in async way,
    06.Routing is about parsing the URL and rearanging the components into the only one HTML file in a SPA app,
    07.Forms and Validation,
    08.Redux is an indipendent library for using only one state for all components,
    09.Authentication for our ReactJS app front side and server side,
    10.Testing,
    11.Deployment to a real server,
    12.Bonus section with Animations and more.
