How do we plan a ReactJS application ?

01.Plan the Component tree, sometimes the ending result is deferent than the initial expectations.
02.Plan the App state - in this case we need to add the ingredients and the final payment for the burger.
03.Conteiners and Components - Which components should be stateless or statefull, container or not.

Having a plan is important !!!


--------------------


Planning our App :

The components and the state


---------------------


Build the new project and eject it from the terminal 
with "npm run eject" for CSS purposes.


---------------------


Create folders for components:
    "components" - will contain all "stateless" or "functional" components,
    "containers" - will contain all "statefull" or "class based" components,
    "hoc" - will contain Higher Order Components

    IF WE ARE NOT USING JSX CODE WE DONT NEED TO IMPORT React from 'react' !


---------------------


Prop-types : 
    Prop-types is a package which allow's us to set types of the value of the props that we 
    will receive.
    It was created by the React team.  

Usage :
    import PropTypes from 'prop-types';


----------------------


Backdrop :
    A backdrop is when we click a button and we set a windowto pulp up,
    we want some darker layer on the back over the full page.
    That is a layout.

    It's a simple div with a darker background color , 100% width and height so it can cover the 
    full page on the back and we need a <-index on the css so it can be over of the the page
    but the z-index has to be lower than the one on the window that pulped up.
    
    This way the window will stay over the backdrop and the backdrop will stay over the page on the back. 


------------------------

IMPORTANT !!!
Updating elements:
    The wrapping element CONTROLS how and when the wrapper element updates.
    That is why we use the componentShouldUpdate(){} lifecicle to control which component updates.
